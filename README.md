## 📝 Abstract

Trajectory data record spatiotemporal information and related attributes of moving objects. High-quality trajectory data can accurately reflect behavior patterns, providing a reliable foundation for traffic management, logistics optimization, and smart city planning. However, existing research on trajectory data quality management remains limited, lacking interactive tools for addressing quality issues and making it difficult for users to explore and resolve problems in trajectory datasets. To address this gap, we present TrajectoryCurer, an interactive visual analytics system designed for trajectory data quality management. Through expert interviews and synthesis of preprocessing operations from 30 relevant articles on trajectory visualization and management, we construct a taxonomy of 19 trajectory data quality issues across six dimensions. Based on this taxonomy, we design a multilevel visualization approach encompassing Trajectory View, Point View, Map View, and Data View, enabling users to observe and address quality issues across multiple dimensions through an integrated interface. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of TrajectoryCurer through two usage scenarios and expert evaluations.
